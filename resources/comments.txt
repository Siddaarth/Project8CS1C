My comments:

I believe the graph reaches its minimum between recursion limits of 8 and 16.

It first decreases(for select array sizes), until recursion limit 8 where it bottoms out until around recursion limit 16 where it only generally rises.

There are many inconsistencies in the runtime that are caused from the randomness of runtime.

For example, the array size of 7.02 million randomly drops off near the end.

There are also many random spikes throughout and drops.

After a recursion limit of 16, runtime is only impacted negatively on average by increasing the recursion limit.
